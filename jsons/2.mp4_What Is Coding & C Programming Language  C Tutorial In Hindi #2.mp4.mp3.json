  "text": " Guys, through this video, you will understand the meaning of coding and programming properly. Guys, in this video, what I am going to tell you today, I wish someone would have told me 5-6 years ago. So, it would be fun. My life changes a little. The thing I have learned from programming, it changes a little. Guys, you do anything through computer. You write in SQL, in code python, in anything. Here, this tutorial is from C. But, I generally talk to you guys that in any language, if you write any code, then why do you do programming? Can't we say this to the computer, that you write a hello word, do this, do that, why can't we do this? I will tell you today. Guys, programming is in any language. It is a way of interaction between us and the computer. It is a way through which we tell the computer what we want to do. In this way, I am using Hindi language to express my emotions. And I am explaining to you guys what C language is. Why do you do programming, why do you do coding. Similarly, to tell the computer that you want to write a hello word on the screen, or you want to record your audio, or you want to watch a movie. To make such computer programs, you have to use a language. To interact with the computer, you have to use a thing, you have to use a programming language, you have to use a medium. This is the medium, this is the medium of programming language, which you tell your CPU what you want to do. Just like I am talking to you guys in Hindi, like I am telling you in Hindi or in English, if you talk to someone, we understand each other's emotions, we understand each other's emotions. Similarly, to interact with the computer, you have to use programming language. Guys, do you like these videos? If you have any questions, do you like these videos?

A computer is a very dumb machine. And to explain it, to explain its CPU, which is called the brain of computer, the central processing unit. If you have not heard it, then I will tell you. The CPU, which is the brain of the computer, is executed by the instructions there. So, the CPU needs the exact language that is understood by it. What to do? If you send it an instruction, then copy it in this, then it will copy it. Do it like this, do it like this. It needs the exact language in its language. How to do it. And if you guys speak in Hindi, like, hello, print, do it like this, then it will not understand at all. This is the problem of the computer. That is why I called the computer a dumb machine. Unfortunately, this language, which is called the CPU, is the language of 0s and 1s. If we can say it, then it will be very difficult for us to do small things in our computer. So, what is its solution? Its solution is simple. For this, you have to go up to a level of abstraction. I will explain what I mean. Guys, any computer system has abstraction layers. That is, the CPU language feeds something else. And it reacts accordingly. This layer of abstraction comes in your mouse and keyboard. You pressed the button of your keyboard, helped you to travel instructions. And from there, your instruction was reached the CPU language. Similarly, if you guys make any program, then you guys want to tell the CPU what you want to do. What program you want to launch, what you want to do, what file you want to copy. There are many aspects in programming. And we will learn all those things in the tutorial series. Basically, you just understand this. Don't get confused at all. The computer, which is a dumb machine, we write programming language to make its language. That is, we compile the programming language and convert it into machine language, which finally understands the CPU. And if we say this language in natural language, then it will not be possible to execute instructions for CPU. Now, I know that you guys are beginners, you are starting programming. To explain all this, I had told you all this. Now, after meeting the cool, you just understand that we cannot directly talk to the computer. We cannot talk to it in English, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu. We want a programming language to interact with it. The programming language, the way you have to learn a French, German language, you have to learn it. And this course is for this. I am going to explain this programming language in a very good way in this course. Don't get confused here. Don't understand that I told you that computer doesn't understand natural language. So, you will be thinking how virtual assistants work. So, guys, virtual assistants are a program in themselves, which is written through some programming language. Like Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana, if you say anything, then it is a computer programming. So, if you have a natural language processing, then programming is also needed. No technology has been made that you guys speak something and directly understand the CPU and execute the instructions. Like you guys say that I want a website where it is like this, this, this, this, do this, click this, click this, click that, and automatically, 100% Cote will be generated. Today, no technology is available in this day and you guys have to do programming. Human intervention will always be required. That is why programming demand is increasing. Like new systems are being added in the market. It is not like programming is getting more expensive. AI machine learning is not yet reaching that far. That you guys should replace it, replace computer programmers. And the demand for C programming like language is increasing. According to that, we will see the C programming jobs increasing in the market. Guys, no one is going to take the C's concept of C's history, but the history of C's history is very interesting. I would like to tell you that C programming language was made by Dennis Richie in 1872 in AT&T Bell Labs. AT&T Bell Labs means American Telephone & Telegraph which is located in the USA. There, Dennis Richie established C programming. It is not like C programming is the first programming language. Like before C programming, there were many programming languages like B, BCPL. But the thing was that in C, people enjoyed it without any advertisement or promotion or any investment. C programming caught the speed and speed of the programers. That it became the first choice of programming language. If I talk about the languages that came before C, then there are Algon, BCPL, B, then in 1972, there was traditional C. Where Dennis Richie made the first version of C. And there people enjoyed it. It is like language. It means it was fun. So, when we used to do programming, people and the programming we do today have a lot of difference. Today we have IDE, we have faster computers. We can do programming very well. But in the olden days, when people used to do programming, they didn't have a good environment. And programming for them was not as easy as it is for us today. That is why Dennis Richie is considered a genius. Dennis Richie was expired in October 12, 2011. Indeed, he gave programming a new shape and he was worthy of being a genius. In C programming language, Dennis Richie added very good features. Like memory management, portability, mid-level, structured. And with that, recursions, pointers. He made it so easy that people started to adopt C without the old language. He was independent and he could compile it for any machine. And he would execute it in that machine. So, I wanted to tell you as much as I could about why C came into existence. Why did we have to make C? Why did Dennis Richie make C? Why did people need C? We have given many examples in the software industry where something that was not good could have been better than that. And all the people came there. I would like to give you an example. On the day of the launch of the social networking platform, all the people came to Facebook and left Facebook behind. Similarly, there are many examples like browser, Google Chrome, better. People left the Internet Explorer. We have many more examples. So, you should understand why people adopted C. Why don't people adopt a reliable, simple and easy to use language? And in the world of today, in which the tools and technology are in the industry there are so many companies on a daily basis. And a language that has been standing on its own for almost 50 years and is going to make its 50th birthday C language, that language will have to be good. That language was liked by people for 50 years. I would like to talk about a topic that people say that already C has replaced C++, C hash and Java Python. Now, C is useless. Now, C has been behind. So, I will clear this doubt for you. See, the C programming language is still as powerful as it used to be and its demand is increasing day by day. People will say that C++ is more than C. But I would like to tell you that to learn C++, you have to learn the concept of C. And C++ has been made through C. C has been made ahead. That is why its name has been given C++ and D has not been given. So, the C++ that Stoustrup made, has been made by giving C object oriented features. So, if you feel that you will learn C++ directly without learning C, then I will tell you. It is not like that. If you learn C first, then you will be able to become a good programmer. I am making these things from my experience. But I would like to tell you that the right way is to learn C and then go to C++. Because C has basics and it has some advanced stuff in C++ like object oriented programming and inheritance, polymorphism, classes, objects. So, it will be difficult to understand all these things. That is why I will tell you to complete a beginner C. And believe me, if you are studying C, then you are making your basic fundamentals strong. Once you understand the fundamentals of programming, then you can learn any language because the basic things should come to your mind. After that, you can learn anything and learn any way. Once you know that you are doing all these things, variables, functions, conditionals, all these things are almost the same in every language. That is why I will tell you to learn C programming language and make your basic fundamentals strong. And I will not point out again and again, but C programming language is extremely fast. If you want to squeeze your performance and write a better program which is fast and reliable, then you can use C programming language. That is why in the video game industry, where you need a good speed and the speed is very important, you can use C and C++. We will learn C programming very systematically. We will start with basic things. We will start from the bottom and then advance slowly. As you all know any language, first you learn its alphabet, then you learn to make words, then you learn to make sentences, then you learn to write paragraphs, then you see how to write the first one, which we call writing. Similarly, in programming, I will tell you which keywords, special symbols, alphabets are there, then we will talk about constants, keywords, variables, etc. Then we will see how we can write instructions, how we can tell the computer what and how to do it, and finally how we can make its program, that is, how we can compile it and make it executable. We will see how we can improve our programming logic, as I told you about writing, here it will be like this, to improve our logic, to execute things in time, to make the program reliable, to make the program easy to maintain, we will see many aspects in this course. We will see all these things step by step. Guys, I am planning to make more courses like data structures, algorithms, C++, and more things. So if you want to support this channel, then share this playlist below, I have given the playlist link in the description, so that I can bring more courses for you. So guys, I hope you will like this video. Don't miss the next video, because we will make our first program in it. And along with making our first program, we will understand how we can install it in our computer. And no, I will not tell you about any old idea, turbo-C, and all that useless things. I will prepare you for the next 5 to 10 years. I will prepare you for the next 5 to 10 years for the job market. I will teach you how to use modern tools, modern compilers, and techniques. This course will be taught with a modern approach. That is why I say that you can subscribe to the channel and press the bell icon. Because these courses go away from the educational channel. I don't want you to lose this channel and leave this course. So subscribe below and press the bell icon. So that you can become a proud member of this channel.
