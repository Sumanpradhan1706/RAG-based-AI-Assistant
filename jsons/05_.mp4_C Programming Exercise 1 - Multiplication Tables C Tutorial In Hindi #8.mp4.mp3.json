  "text": " So guys, we have learned a lot of things and we have learnt a lot of concepts. In today's video, I will give you guys an exercise. Accept the challenge, see the video completely, understand the question and then write a challenge accepted in the comment section. If you are going to complete the exercise. So guys, here we will start with a simple exercise. In which we will have some basic functions and operators. Which we have studied till now. So, whatever knowledge you have got in these simple videos, you will understand very well how to use it. So, don't miss this exercise at all. I will take you guys to my Visual Studio Code, to my computer, where I will come and explain what you have to do in this exercise. So, let's go to the computer and I will explain what is the question. So guys, before we move on, I will tell you a problem statement. I will tell you that after opening the channel, access the C programming playlists. Because you have to keep the playlists of this course in mind. Then you will be able to learn properly. As the videos will be added, you will continue the course. So, you click on the star here and bookmark. Bookmark comes here and you can click here and access it anytime. Now I am here in my Visual Studio Code, I will show you what you have to do here. This is our tutorial number 8. So, I will write here simply, Tutorial 8 and I will write colon here. Or I will write dash here. Exercise1.C So, this is our C program. I will write here simply main. And I will prepare it as main. These int, argc and argv, I would like to tell you that there are command line arguments. And you don't have to pay much attention to them. You can remove it for now. We will see what they used later. One more thing here is hash include stdio.h. Do this. stdio.h. Okay. After doing this, what you have to write here is, You have to solve the problem. I have to tell you what is the statement of the problem. So, I will simply put star here and after that, I will put star here and slash here. This is the multi-line comments. I will tell you in the next video about comments. You can understand the problem statements. Comments are not a big thing. What you have to do here is, Print a multiplication table of a number entered by the user in... I will close the word wrap here. I would like to tell you that there is a command called toggle word wrap. If you open the command first, And you will do toggle word wrap here, The one you will write here won't overflow. It will come down from the new line. As you can see here. So, you can see it easily. I will close it so that you can see it easily. So, print multiplication table of a number entered by the user in pretty form. Example. I will give you an example. I will give you an example of the input and output. Example, I will write here. I will write here. Enter the number you want multiplication table of. Okay. After that, you have to print the number 6. So, you have to print something like this. And the output here is your input. I will write here. And the output here will come here like this. One thing I would like to tell you here is that you will get this code in the description. So, you will get the problem statement below. And I will close the terminal here because I am not running it. So, what do you want in the input and what do you want in the output? I have told you. So, it is in the input. Enter the number you want multiplication table of. After that, 6 came. And in the output, you will get something like this. Table of 6. And here you have to write something like this. And with 0, you have to write 6, 2, 6, 3. And you have to write it up to 10. So, you have to write it up to 10. 6, 10, 60. So, I am putting this dot dot. But you don't have to put dot dot. You have to print the actual table. You have understood what I want to say. So, if you want to print any table, enter the number and you will see its table. Write down the challenge accepted in the comment. And also, you have to access the course playlist here. And bookmark it and keep it in mind so that you don't lose this channel. And you can also subscribe to the channel. So, the channel won't lose and this course won't lose. And you guys can easily solve this question. Write the challenge accepted and solve the question. So, if you guys solve this and write the challenge accepted, I will give a heart to everyone in the comment. Then there will be a solution video for this video. In which everyone will be given a shout out. All the people who have solved it. I will give a shout out to each and every one of them. So, you have to solve this problem. So, I will do it. I will put it on my website. You will get the link in the description. And you guys access the problem statement. So, guys, I hope you guys will answer this exercise. You will write the challenge accepted in the comment. I want you to fill the comment section with challenge accepted. Challenge accepted. Fill it with challenge accepted. Let's post our comment right now. Challenge accepted. You will also have to get it. And I will also see that higher people are learning. People are interested in solving the questions. So, right now, you put the challenge accepted. Because this question is not that difficult. I know you will do it. Comment below. Like the challenge accepted and this video. Like the like button below. Make it blue. Like it. And I will be very happy. With that, I want you to do this course in some programming group. And with that, if you do your job. If you have any group, then share it there. There is a share button below. You can click on it and share these videos. For yourself, you can see the playlist link in the description. Click on it and see the playlist right now. At least, if you see the playlist, you will have a whole overview. That, yes, I have seen these videos. And these videos are still there.

You can easily do bookmark and save it. Or subscribe to this channel so that your playlist doesn't get lost. So, I hope you guys liked the video. Do like it. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. I will meet you guys in its solution video. And let's see who solves it first. And who solves it right. How many people accept the challenge below. So, after this video, I want to see a lot of things. So, thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
