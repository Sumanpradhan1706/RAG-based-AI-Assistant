  "text": " C programs are made by many people but today whatever you see in this video will be able to understand it well and as a result, logic will be able to make it well. Don't miss this video. So guys, till now whatever we have learned about C programming was either history or installation or some other important things but from today we will start with the basic building blocks which are made by C program. So to make C program, first of all we wrote some texts. Now we will talk about what was in the text and spend some time here. I will take you back to my Visual Studio Code ID and take you there and I will tell you what was the meaning of the program we wrote. This will increase your understanding and you will understand why things are written in C program. So guys, a C program is made by combining constants, identifiers, string literals, keywords and symbols. We will see these things closely in this video. What is the meaning of this program and what is the meaning of C programming language. And when C programming language was created and evolved over the period of time, then why all these things were made like this. So guys, first of all I would like to talk about tokens. Now in C program is made by combining individual tokens. If I want to break printf hello world into tokens, then my program will look something like you are still seeing on your screen. But to make this representation better, we write this program like this. We write it in compact form and skip the new line. Every statement is made by a semi colon in termination C programming. Guys, you must have heard a lot of jokes that semi colon is forgotten, semi colon is the biggest thief, semi colon is the brain of a programmer. So guys, there is nothing called semi colon, it is used to terminate a statement. And if you have not put this semi colon, your program will give you an error, your compiler will tell you, I can't do anything, the compiler will stand in his hand and will tell you that I can't do anything. I can't compile this program, I can't make executable of this program, I can't make your code software because I don't know what it is written. Because of missing the semi colon. So guys, now I would like to take you to my Visual Studio Code ID. And I will show you what is the basic building blocks in the program that I wrote. So guys, I have come to my Visual Studio Code, I will request you all, now listen to what I am telling you. And as I am doing, you all watch it. One more thing I would like to ask you all, do you want a page PDF after this course as a summary? Or do you want me to start supplying you notes with these videos? Do let me know in the comment section and if you have said yes, we want these notes, yes we want these one page PDF after this course, then I will definitely bring them for you. So do let me know in the comment section if you want or not, everyone should definitely tell me. Let's move ahead as you can see I am in the Visual Studio Code. Here I will open my old program which I had opened. You can see here that on my screen, this basic structure I explained in the last video was C program. Now we will see its building blocks, the parts like int, curly brace, main, I had told you all. But I will tell you all the main words in this video. Guys, a C program is made with the help of tokens. When I talk about tokens, it means the parts that make C program are making C program, its basic building blocks. Like we wrote this program in our last video in which we print hello word on the screen. If I break it on individual tokens, it will look like this. I have separated printf, this symbol, I have separated this string literal, then after that I have separated the semicolon and this. I could do it like this, then also it will run as expected. As you can see, this hello word has been printed. So what I did is I broke it in individual tokens. So one token will be keyword or identifier, or constant, or string literal, or symbol. What is keyword? First of all, I will talk about keywords. Keywords are reserved words in C programming language. In C programming language, there are 32 general purpose keywords that you are seeing in your screen. So these keywords are in C programming language, they are general purpose keywords. And these are reserved words. You cannot make any identifier of these words, you cannot make any variable. These keywords are reserved in C programming language. Like you are looking at the return, this is keyword, you are looking at int, this is keyword. So these are reserved words that you cannot use in your programming language. In any identifier, in any constant or variable name. Let's talk about identifiers. Look, identifiers can be the name of any variable, any function, so that we can identify it. That's it, the theory of identifiers. I don't want to make a separate video for this, it's a simple thing. Look, any name that you want to give to any variable or function. Like your mom, Rohan, Shubham or Vikrant, whatever you call it, we will make our function, variable, and the entities like constants, we call them identifiers. Now in identifiers, capital A to capital Z, small a to small z, and with that, we can underscore and letter numbers. So what does C allow in the name of variables, we will see in the next video. Just keep in mind that C does not allow punctuation characters, either a dollar, percent, or identifiers. Along with that, I would like to tell you that C is a case-sensitive programming language. That is, if I name any variable, capital H, and then I name another variable, small h, then they will be different. After that, in our C programming language, we used a semicolon. Like I told you, first, the semicolon statement is used to terminate. We have already broken it in the initial tokens, but we make it compact and keep it readable. And we understand it manually in our mind what the token is and we compact it and put one line, that is, the line of the semicolon, in one single line. That is, I have removed all the white spaces and new lines that I have extracted. I did this so that my program becomes readable. Along with that, there are some constants in our program, like zero is the constant. In the coming time, I will also tell you how to make a constant. I will also tell you the difference between variable and constant. Along with that, the hello word was a string literal, that is, it was a string. And as soon as I did this, you see, it says care and after that it says 13 is its size. And with that, it shows me what value is. Now, how is this, we will understand it further. You guys understand one thing at a time. After that, our symbols come. Suppose if I write scanf here and after that, I write %d here. After that, I write %am%a. So, my symbol is m% and all these are symbols. So, our program is made by combining keyword, identifier, constant, string literal and symbol. You can also note it down somewhere. Keyword, identifier, constant, string literal and symbol. Along with that, if you want to note down, the general purpose of C, reserved keywords. I have just brought them on the screen for you. You can write it somewhere. But you don't have to remember all of them. You can refer them back. But you should know which keywords are in C programming. In my previous program, I made some temporary files. Which I made to show you how C programs work. I delete them here. Because I don't want to keep all of them here. Along with that, I delete the EXC. We will compile the program and run it. Another thing I want to tell you is that you can add any white space in your program. Suppose I add some white space here. Between my tokens, It won't matter. My program will be successfully compiled. Along with that, if I add 10 space here. Suppose I add 10 space here. And after that, if I run it, it will be successfully compiled and executed. As you can see here, I have executed it. I will tell you the feature of a Visual Studio Code. Suppose I want to open main.c and add.c side by side. You can use this button here. You can use this button here. You can use this button here. And your screen will be split in two. So, it will be independent. You can zoom out easily. And it won't be independent. You can debug both of these codes. You can see what was in which code I was using. You can open multiple editors here. In one of these windows. I will tell you that you should use an ID. It is a very useful thing. I will take my program in normal state. I want to mention one thing. There should be at least one white space character in between the tokens. If I write return 0 here. Then our program won't be able to understand. This is different from return and 0 is different. That's why it will throw an error. I will show you. It should be at least one white space character. Return and then the value return. So that our program can identify that this is return 0 1. Return and 0 return 0 are different. So, you will understand all these things while you are doing this. But I hope that the basic idea and the basic building blocks of the C program that you have understood. The upcoming videos are going to be very important. I will tell you about variables and constants. And I will tell you about data types. The main C will start from there. So, I will tell you about the upcoming videos. So, save this playlist and bookmark it somewhere. Or subscribe to the channel. Whatever you want to keep. Keep it carefully so that the course doesn't go around. I have given the link of the course in the description. You can take this course from there. So, guys, I hope that you understood all this video. If you are enjoying the course of the C tutorials, please tell me in the comment how you liked this video.
