  "text": " In this video, I will tell you about variables and data types. And I will tell you why variables are important and what are data types. In C programming, we will make variables and data types and what we do and why such needs are required. This video is going to be very well-known. So, don't miss this video even if you make a mistake. So guys, the way there is a box and you give some luggage in that box. And with that, you can only give the same amount of luggage in that box. The capacity of that box and the variables are the same. We have a box and a food box where we store data in memory. Now, suppose I give you a box and that box is for keeping the dal. So, you will put the dal in it and not the water. And if I give you a big bottle, what will you put in it? You will put water in it and store it. And you will never store the dal in it. Because it is designed to hold water. And the variables in C also have a type. The data type tells you what kind of variable is going to come in it. Do you understand what I am saying? It tells you what kind of variable is going to come in it. If it is the pot of dal, it will bring dal. And if it is the bottle of water, it will bring water. Nothing else can come. In C programming, we have care, float, in double the types of data types. Everyone is going to break down in this video. And watch this video completely. And if I ever release any PDF cheat sheet with this video, I will be able to give it to you. Comment below. I want the cheat sheet so that I can give you the cheat sheet as soon as it is ready. I will reply to you by commenting. So, there is a name for the variable on the variable. Which we give to the storage area. That we are going to store here. Like this thing. Like an int variable, I will store integer in it. Care variable, I will store a character in it. I will tell you all these things through the program. It will be more helpful to you. So, let's do this. Let's go to Visual Studio Code IDE. And understand the program, the request in the IDE. Sit comfortably. Drink water and tea. And listen to me carefully. Because these are the things that I have learned very difficultly. And here I have come to teach you all these things very easily. So listen to me carefully. So guys, today's topic of this video is Variables and Data Types in C. And before understanding the variables and data types, I want to tell you all here. What is the flow of C program? Once again. Now you will say, why am I telling you all this once again? And the reason is that it is a little important. So what will we do here? We will understand the variables and data types. So first of all, when you compile C program, then it is our pre-processing. What happens in pre-processing? In pre-processing, there are simply some basic steps. Like the removal of the comments. And along with that, there are two or four other things. Which I have told you in the previous video. After that, our main compilation happens. After that, there is assembly. After that, it creates assembler objects. After that, your program is linked. And after that, your program is loaded in RAM. Now what is RAM? First of all, your program is loaded in RAM. Your RAM is Random Access Memory. After that, your program is loaded. And after that, it runs from there. So your RAM, whenever I say memory, it means RAM. So your RAM works as memory here. So don't confuse memory with hard disk. Memory means RAM here. So when I say that the program is loaded in memory, it means that the program is loaded in RAM. It is 4GB RAM, 8GB RAM. So that RAM is the same. So the more RAM, the more programs you can open. Why? Because all the programs have to be loaded in RAM. So this was our basic load C program. Now what is this variable? Like I told you that our program is loaded in RAM. And after that, its execution starts there. So this variable is a name. Like your name is also a name that is given to memory location. If this is your RAM, then there is a location here. So these are the blocks of our memory. I am telling you roughly, if this is your memory, then this memory is divided into blocks. And the basic unit of this can be a 0 or 1 store. Like we know that the computer does not store any number directly. It stores it in the form of 0 and 1. So here, what will happen is that the name given to a memory location is our variable. So this variable is our name given to memory location. Nothing more than this. Now if we talk about C programming language, then it is declared. I will write type and after that I will write the name of the variable. Like I wrote here int a and put semicolon. If I have to declare two variables together, then I can do that too. So I can write int a, b, semicolon. And along with that, I can write something like this. int a, b, c, d and semicolon. So this is also a valid C statement. Declaring means that I am telling my compiler. Look, we are going to use four integers. One is a, b, c, d. Reserve the place for these four. Like you remember, I used to call and say, Hello, yes, keep the place for me. You used to go to your school or school where the seat was the best. Or if you go to your school bus or college bus, then you will say, Hello, yes, keep the seat for me. So reserve it. Similarly, we have to reserve the space for the variable. So this is the reservation. So we reserve the space. Now here you give the compiler the guarantee that you will use it and the compiler trusts you. So you need four seats. That is, four integer variables. The integer takes all the memory. Multiply by four, it will reserve for a, b, c and d. Now initialization is a different term. Initialization means that you gave the value of the same. Now when you want to give the value of the same, then what will you do? Then simply write something like this. int a is equal to four. So a is the place for that. Reserve the place and put four in that place. That is, you gave the value of your variable. So simply initialize and write it in the statement. You can do something like this in your C program. You wrote int a and after that you wrote a is equal to four. So this is a valid C program. So we will write more in the coming time and understand these things. But I hope you are taking notes from the basics. Now let's come to rules for defining a variable. Now what are the rules to keep the name of a variable? For example, there are some basic rules to keep the name of a person. That they should not be the name of any object. You can't keep the name of any person. Or you can't keep the name of any person. Similarly, the name of the variable for C is also defined by some rules. So the first rule we have here is that can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores. So what can contain? Alphabets, digits, and underscores. So these three can be made. Alphabets can be made, underscores can be made, digits can be made. So what happened is that if I write here int Harry, then this is a valid variable name. And here I write int underscore Harry, this is also a valid variable name. Now here I have to terminate it from the semicolon. So this will be our protocol throughout the course. You have to remember that you have to put the semicolon. Now here I am saying that a variable name can start with an alphabet and underscore only. That is, it cannot start with numbers. It can start with alphabets and underscores. Like I have written here int Harry, or int underscore Harry. Now here I can write Harry 9 or underscore Harry 9. So that is also fine. But if I write something like this, int, that is, I need an integer variable, of the name 9. So this variable of the name 9, this is not a valid variable. This is an invalid name. So this can't start with a digit. Like I have mentioned in the third point. It can't start with a digit. It can't start with a digit. So we covered the first point here. We covered the second point here. We covered the third one here. It can't start with a digit. Now let's talk about the word for white space and reserved. Suppose you have given the name int int. Or you have given the name int long. Which is the reserved keyword whose name I have just told you. So if I long int, then this is absolutely wrong. And this will throw an error. So here if I long int, then what will happen? It will say that long is the word for reserved. You can't keep the long name. You can't keep the name of a person's name like a chair or table. Similarly, you can't keep the name long. So here we covered the point. Now let's talk about the white space. If I write int and harry space, I write shubham. So here we have a white space. So this is an invalid name again. If I put the semicolon, then it will be invalid. So this is an invalid name of the variable. You can't keep the name of the space. So I hope you have understood. You have given the fourth point. Now in the fifth and sixth point, I have given you some examples. So here we have a valid variable. For example, if I write int harry, then this is a valid variable. I have given float harry123. This is a valid variable. Car underscore harry34. This is a valid variable. It satisfies all the rules. With that, I have already cut and shown the invalid variables. But with that, I have given you some more examples. You can also increase the C programming by keeping these examples. So these are the small things that you have to keep in mind. I hope this was simple and you understood it. Now let's talk about the data types. What is the data type? You have just seen what I was writing int. That was our data type. Whenever I declare a variable, I have to tell my computer that what I am doing, I want an integer variable. Or I want a floating point where the decimal is the number. Or I want a double number where the precision is a little bit more. These are our basic data types. Now what I have told you about the basic data types? I have told you about an int. I have told you about a car. And I have told you about a float. These four are our basic data types. Now we have derived data types. What are derived data types? To make them, you need basic data types. I have covered the basic data types. We have derived data types which are required to make basic data types. That is why they are called derived. They are derived from basic data types. So we have these. Pointer, structure, union. I will discuss these in detail. Now you hold them. Then we have an enumeration data type. We will discuss this too. And I will tell you about the void data type. Void means nothing but empty. So void means nothing. So we call void nothing. Now I have kept some data types for you. I thought I will make a list for you. Where I have data types. And how much size does it take in memory. And what is its range. It depends on the architecture. What is the memory. It depends on the architecture. For example, if I write care. If I write care. I wrote something like this in my program. Care c is equal to c. Now these single quotes denote that this is a character. So I said store this in c. So what will happen. How much memory will it take in my RAM. As I told you, the variable is nothing. Location is named in memory. So the RAM that will be in my RAM. It will say. I have one byte for you. That is 8 bits. We have 8 bits. 8 bits and 1 bit can be 0 or 1 store. So our 8 bits will be reserved. So the 8 bits in our RAM will be reserved. Now how big is your RAM. If you consider your RAM of 4GB. Now there are 32GB RAM in the machine. It is very common. But consider the RAM of 4GB. In 1GB it is 1024MB. So this will be 4x124MB. And after that it will be 1024x1024 Multiply by 1024KB Kilobyte And after that it will be 4x1024x1024 x1024x1024 x1024 bytes And if I want to convert this to bits. So I will write this whole here. And I will multiply it. From which 8. So many 0's and 1's. Your RAM can store your memory. So you calculate this. And see how big this is. So our RAM can be very data in our computer. So we can run big movies and big programs. So this character C is equal to C is a very small thing for our RAM. So it will be reserved. But as our programs get complicated. We will make arrays and structures. I will tell you all this. Then our RAM will consume a lot of things. So this RAM will be very less. This RAM will be less for your complex programs. So you should understand this. Along with that we have signed care, unsigned care. Short, short, signed short. Unsigned short, end, signed end. And similarly we have float and double. So these are all data types. And how many memory do we take? 32 bit architecture. So these values that I have given here. You don't have to remember them. And this architecture to architecture is not going to be done. So this is not like you have written a rattle for 32 bit architecture. If there is a second architecture which processes instructions in a different way. The compiler will allocate different memory. I have seen that people give it a rattle. The character takes 1 byte. Short takes 2 byte. End takes 2 byte. Some people take 4 byte. Architecture to architecture depends on this. You don't have to remember it. Now I will take you to my computer. And there I will show you in Visual Studio Code. Which is related to this and important. So here is my Visual Studio Code. If I write here. I have written print hello word here. So I will do this. I will make a new program. I will make it in the name of size.c. And I will do it in the name of size1.c. And here I will do it. I will write the main. And I will do it in the name of Visual Studio Code. I don't read it because of intelligence. I will copy and paste it. I will do it by doing control. And here I will print. And here I will write. I will write percentage. LU is used for unsigned long. And I will write size of. And after that I will write. Here you see. I have written size of. So here I have come. I will do it. So it is telling me that size of function is there. And if I write int here. Now I will write it here. gcc size1.c. So I will write gcc. And I will press size. And after that I will press a. And I will enter. So here it is 4 print. So our integer is taking 4 bytes. In this architecture. Similarly I will tell you. Unsigned int long. By these data types. Print the space to go. And after printing. You will know some things. And you will understand. Guys I will tell you one more thing. I will teach you operators of functions. And I will teach you very well. So don't take any tension. But here I want to tell you one thing. That we should know about some basic things. Like. Some plus minus times divide. You can use it in C programming. If you write here. Print f. And after that you write. 3 plus 7. So your 10 will be printed. So you should know. That you can use plus minus times divide. So you should know this. Because I will give you an exercise. In which this knowledge will be used. And I want you to know about this. So plus minus times divide. And what is the truth. Some basic functions. I have given you very little idea about functions. I don't know much. But I just want to tell you that. Print f. And you should know about scanf. If I write percent d. And here I have to do m percent a. So before that I will have to declare a. And after that I can take it from user. Value. Means user can give value from keyboard. And store value in a. And my program will store value in a. Whatever will be input in our user keyboard. So these two things you should know. So I have told you two functions. Print f. And in fact I have told you size of. But about functions. You should understand that this is. Like our function of maths. A square plus b square. So what will you do. F a b if I have written a square is equal to a square plus b square. So what will be our F11. 1 square plus 1 square. So I have to take multiple input values. And one output is given. So here the value of F11 is 1. So in the same way our function. Is like a function of mathematics. It takes input and gives some output. I hope you all will be clear about all this. So operators of function are in detail. Although I will tell you. But here I have to give a little basic idea. At least we should have this idea. Along with that I would like to tell you. If you want to store any number point. Then you can use float or double. Or you can use float or float. This is simply. This is a 32 bit representation. Of a real number. Because it is taking 4 bytes. So 32 bit representation. I am multiplying it from 8. And this is 64. And what is happening in this architecture. If I multiply it from 8. So this is taking 80 bits. So how many bits are taking here. Now the number representation. If I do that. I will be able to get the same decimal points. If it is precision. So float's precision is generally 6-7 decimal points. So guys I hope you all have cleared the data type. Along with this video. Some of you ask me. How can we help you. So I would like to tell you. If you want to help me. Then press the share button. You have sent this course to many people. If you have a programming group. Which is in your school or class. Or if you work in a company. If you work in a company. Then you will have an official group. You will have this playlist. The link of this course playlist. You can share it in that group. You can share this video. I will be very helpful. And I will give you more courses like data structure. C++. There are many things that I want to teach you. So do help me in this initiative. I need this a lot. Guys when I made this course. So many comments. I thought that your video should be good. So I am very happy. I want to tell you. All the people who have liked this video. And made this course a success. Thank you so much guys. I want to thank you. And I want to promise you. That I will bring good courses for you. The upcoming videos will be very interesting. You will have to do all the exercises. And as I tell you to do. I will have to teach you. So that's all for now. In the upcoming videos. We will see what are the other important things. How to do it. If possible. Do click on the bookmark. Before that. Subscribe to the channel. Hit the bell icon. So thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."
